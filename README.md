Semi-useful Discord bot for FRC things.

Named because I was listening to Hey DJ by CNCO.

Made with too much time that I should have been doing other things with, by Zia
from 8884.

Use `;help` to get usage information for the bot.

## Todo

### Useful
- [ ] Make leaderboard into teams and list attending teams if event has not started
- [ ] competition year stats (`;year 8884`)
- [ ] alliance number and result (`;ally [event] 8884` = `alliance 1 capt, 9999 & 9990, came 1st`)

### Not too important
- [ ] common alliance partners (`;friends 8884`)
- [ ] win and loss streak records (`;streak 8884`)
- [ ] teams that haven't been beaten by this team (`;hopeless 8884`)
- [ ] teams that this team hasnt lost to (`;unbeaten 8884`)
