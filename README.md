Semi-useful Discord bot for FRC things.

Named because I was listening to Hey DJ by CNCO.

Made with too much time that I should have been doing other things with, by Zia

## Todo

- [ ] Read correct values for EPA based on that year's gamepieces

### Useful
- [ ] lifetime stats (`;life 8884`)
- [x] event stats (`;epa [event] 8884 [year]`)
- [ ] competition year stats (`;year 8884`)
- [x] win rate (`;wlratio 8884` = `1000 played, 670 won = 67% win rate`)
- [ ] awards (`;awards 8884`)
- [ ] alliance nr and result (`;ally [event] 8884` = `alliance 1 capt, 2056 & 1114, came 1st`)

### Not too important
- [ ] common alliance partners (`;friends 8884`)
- [ ] win and loss streak records (`;streak 8884`)
- [ ] teams that havent been beaten by this team (`;hopeless 8884`)
- [ ] teams that this team hasnt lost to (`;unbeaten 8884`)
